# HTML Code-Exploration

This project is my first website written in HTML. It serves as an educational resource for understanding the basics of HTML, including elements, attributes, forms, and more. Recently, I have learned HTML and  wanted to implement my knowledge, so i built this project to showcase what I have learned. I understand that HTML is used to create the structure of a webpage, and while it doesn't look very polished without CSS, I have added simple internal styling to improve readability. I am planning to learn CSS soon, and will implement it here to enhance the visual appeal.
